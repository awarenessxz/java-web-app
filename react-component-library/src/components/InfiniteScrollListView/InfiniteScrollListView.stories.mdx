# Infinite Scrolling List View Component [DEPRECATED]

This is a infinite scrolling list view that is meant to mimic how outlook email list. This project is made possible
because of [joshtronic](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-react-infinite-scroll). Check out his
explanation on how to implement infinite scrolling in React Component.

**Future Improvement**
- currently new data is appended into the list inside the component. If there is a change in order, this will break the
component. Hence, improvement will have to be made on data that changes dynamically.
- Read/Unread Feature
- Badges
- Write Test Cases!!

## Usage

To use this component, do the following:

1. Add the library as dependency
    - `yarn add react-component-library`
2. Import the component
    ```
    import { InfiniteScrollListView } from 'react-component-library';
    ```

## Properties

<ArgsTable of={InfiniteScrollListView} />

### Data To Item Mapping

As we are making this component dynamic, the data returned from api is different. Hence, `dataToItemMapping` variable
will map the data retrieved from the api to the `ListViewItem` object. Below is an example scenario

- Fetch API returns the following object
    ```
    {
        id: 123123
        header: something,
        result: asdasdasd
    }
    ```

- When using the Component, set the `dataToItemMapping` parameter as shown
    ```
    <InfiniteScrollListView
        ...
        dataToItemMapping: {
            id: 'id',                   # maps id to id
            title: 'header',            # maps header to title
            message: 'result',          # maps result to message
        },
        ...
    />
    ```
