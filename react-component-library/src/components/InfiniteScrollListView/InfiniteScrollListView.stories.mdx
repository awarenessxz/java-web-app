# Infinite Scrolling List View Component

This is a infinite scrolling list view that is meant to mimic how outlook email list. This project is made possible
because of [joshtronic](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-react-infinite-scroll). Check out his
explanation on how to implement infinite scrolling in React Component.

**Future Improvement**
- currently new data is appended into the list inside the component. If there is a change in order, this will break the
component. Hence, improvement will have to be made on data that changes dynamically.
- Read/Unread Feature
- Badges
- Write Test Cases!!

## Usage

To use this component, do the following:

1. Add the library as dependency
    - `yarn add react-component-library`
2. Import the component
    ```
    import { InfiniteScrollListView } from 'react-component-library';
    ```

## Properties

<ArgsTable of={InfiniteScrollListView} />

### Data API

The component will be dynamically calling a rest api to provide it with data. Below are some of the format you should adhere to:

#### 1. API end point

You should expose an API end point in the following format `/any/api/url?limit=?&offset=?`. The component assumes that
the end point is in the format above. Hence, a clearer picture of what the props in the properties table will be as
follows:
- dataApiUrl -- api url `eg. /any/api/url`
- dataLimit -- amount of data to fetch (Refer to SQL)
- dataOffset -- current position of data (Refer to SQL)

#### 2. Data to Item Mapping
This components accepts data in the following format:

```
{
    id: string;
    title: string;
    message: string;
}
```

Hence, we provided an `dataToItemMapping` prop for you to map the data which your api returns to the format accepted by
the component. Below is an example scenario.

- Fetch API returns the following object
    ```
    {
        id: 123123
        header: something,
        result: asdasdasd
    }
    ```

- When using the Component, set the `dataToItemMapping` parameter as shown
    ```
    <InfiniteScrollListView
        ...
        dataToItemMapping: {
            id: 'id',                   # maps id to id
            title: 'header',            # maps header to title
            message: 'result',          # maps result to message
        },
        ...
    />
