# Infinite Scrolling List View Component

This is a infinite scrolling list view that is meant to mimic how outlook email list. This project is made possible
because of [joshtronic](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-react-infinite-scroll). Check out his
explanation on how to implement infinite scrolling in React Component.

**Future Improvement**
- currently new data is appended into the list inside the component. If there is a change in order, this will break the
component. Hence, improvement will have to be made on data that changes dynamically.
- Read/Unread Feature
- Badges
- Write Test Cases!!

## Usage

To use this component, do the following:

1. Add the library as dependency
    - `yarn add react-component-library`
2. Import the component
    ```
    import { InfiniteScrollListView } from 'react-component-library';
    ```

## Properties

<ArgsTable of={InfiniteScrollListView} />

### Data API

The component will be dynamically calling a rest api to provide it with data. Below are some of the format you should adhere to:

#### 1. API end point

You should expose an API end point in the following format `/any/api/url?limit=?&offset=?`. The component assumes that
the end point is in the format above. Hence, a clearer picture of what the props in the properties table will be as
follows:
- dataApiUrl -- api url `eg. /any/api/url`
- dataLimit -- amount of data to fetch (Refer to SQL)
- dataOffset -- current position of data (Refer to SQL)

#### 2. Data to Item Mapping

This components accepts data retrieved from API in the following format:

```
{
    id: string;
    title: string;
    message: string;
    displayDateTime: string;        # obtained via moment(). Eg. 2020-12-08T04:53:51.822Z
    isFlagged: boolean              # [Optional] -- default = false
}
```

Hence, we provided an `dataToItemMapping` prop for you to map the data which your api returns to the format accepted by
the component. Below is an example scenario.

- Fetch API returns the following object
    ```
    {
        id: '123123'                               # (string)
        header: 'something',                       # (string)
        result: 'asdasdasd',                       # (string)
        creationDate: '2020-12-08T04:53:51.822Z',  # obtained via moment() -- (string)
        isActive: true                             # indicator whether to show a flag -- (boolean)
    }
    ```

- When using the Component, set the `dataToItemMapping` parameter as shown
    ```
    <InfiniteScrollListView
        ...
        dataToItemMapping: {
            id: 'id',                       # maps id to id (string)
            title: 'header',                # maps header to title (string)
            message: 'result',              # maps result to message (string)
            displayDateTime: 'creationDate' # maps creationDate to displayDateTime (string)
            isFlagged: 'isActive'           # maps isActive to isFlagged (boolean)
        },
        ...
    />

#### 3. onItemClick callback

OnItemClick callback will be called when the an item in the scroll list is clicked. The original data which was retrieved
from the rest API would be returned. Important things to note:

- For props `dataIsFlaggedReadList`, the component will keep a state of the "id" inside `dataIsFlaggedReadList`. Whenever
there are any item clicks, the component will update the **state inside the component** and **NOT the list** which was
passed into the component via `dataIsFlaggedReadList`. Hence, if you want to update the list which you pass into the props,
please handle the logic on your own.
